    "media": "M9 minimal media composed of M9 media salts (6.78 g/L Na2HPO4, 3 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L NH4Cl, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 0.34 g/L thiamine hydrochloride, 0.4% D-glucose, 0.2% Casamino acids, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1 mM CaCl2; kanamycin (50 ug/ml), spectinomycin (50 ug/ml)",

    "growth": "Inoculation: Individual colonies into M9 media, 16 hours overnight in plate shaker. Dilution: Next day, cells dilute ~200-fold into M9 media with antibiotics, growth for 3 hours. Induction: Cells diluted ~650-fold into M9 media with antibiotics. Growth: shaking incubator for 5 hours. Arrest protein production: PBS and 2mg/ml kanamycin. Measurement: flow cytometry, data processing for REU normalization.",

    "plasmid_description": "pUC19 plasmid backbone with kanamycin resistance and a GFP expression cassette. Upstream insulation by terminator L3S3P21 and a 5’-promoter spacer. Promoter BBa_J23101, ribozyme RiboJ, RBS BBa_B0064 drives constitutive GFP expression, with transcriptional termination by L3S3P21.",
    "plasmid_sequence": "[all lines of the Genbank file (not shown) for the JL2 measurement standard plasmid]",
    "normalization_instructions": "The following equation converts the median GFP fluorescence to REU. REU = (GFP – GFP0)/(GFPREU – GFP0), where GFP is the median fluorescence of the cells of interest, GFP0 is the median autofluorescence, and GFPREU is the median fluorescence of the cells containing the JL2 measurement standard plasmid."
